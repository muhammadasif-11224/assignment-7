# Interactive Number Exploration Tool

## Overview

This Python program is designed to be an interactive tool for exploring numbers. It provides a personalized experience by asking for the user's name and their three favorite numbers. It then performs several operations on these numbers, including checking if they are even or odd, calculating their squares, and summing them up. Finally, it determines if the sum is a prime number and informs the user.

## Features

1. **Personalized Greeting**: The program starts by asking the user's name and then greets them personally.
2. **Number Checking**: It checks if each of the user's three favorite numbers is even or odd.
3. **Squares Calculation**: It calculates and displays the square of each number.
4. **Sum Calculation**: It computes the sum of the three numbers and displays it.
5. **Prime Check**: It checks if the sum is a prime number and informs the user accordingly.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**:
    - The program prompts the user for their name and their three favorite numbers.

2. **Number Properties**:
    - For each number, the program checks if it is even or odd and stores this information in a list of tuples.

3. **Squares Calculation**:
    - The program calculates the square of each number and stores these values in tuples.

4. **Sum and Prime Check**:
    - It computes the sum of the three numbers and checks if this sum is a prime number.

5. **Output**:
    - The program prints a personalized message with the user's name, the even/odd status of each number, the squares of each number, the sum, and whether the sum is a prime number.

## Example
## Functions

- **`is_prime(n)`**: Checks if the given number `n` is a prime number.
- **`main()`**: Manages the user interaction, calculations, and output.
